# ParksAndRex
A recommendation application for fossil-collecting. Users submit their address and preferred search radius, and ten public parks are recommended and displayed along with local fossil and geologic history.

## Motivation
I wanted to create an easy, interactive way to learn about local geologic history for educational contexts and amateur naturalists.
## Summary
A user submits a search address and preferred search radius on the landing page. Once the form information is submitted, the page displays a map with markers correlating to each park recommendation. Park recommendations are listed below the map and ordered by fossil significance and prominence. When a park is selected, more information is displayed to the user, including: address of the park, the geologic time periods available in each park (e.g. how old is the available area), a summary of each geologic time period's importance/events with links to more information, how many fossils have been found in/near the selected park, and detailed information on each fossil collection.  


If no fossil collections have been found in the preferred search radius or there are less than ten parks with fossil occurences, park recommendations are made based on local prominence and distance.
